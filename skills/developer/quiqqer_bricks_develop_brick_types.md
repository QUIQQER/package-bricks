# QUIQQER Bricks Develop Brick Types

Use this skill to build a brick type in a package. For editing brick instances in a project, load
`quiqqer_bricks_create_and_edit_blocks` instead.

## Load The Core Skills

The following skills are provided by `quiqqer/core` and are expected to be available. Load them before
editing the corresponding files; their rules override legacy patterns found in older bricks:

- Always load `quiqqer_frontend_css_variables` for CSS or settings that affect styling. Use its complete
  three-layer pattern, not only a direct CSS variable on the control.
- Always load `quiqqer_frontend_accessibility` when PHP, templates, or JavaScript produce or modify markup,
  including markup in backend setting controls.
- Load `quiqqer_frontend_javascript` for every JavaScript change. Keep AMD and `new Class` as QUIQQER
  infrastructure, but write new DOM logic in vanilla JavaScript and select through `data-name`.
- Load `quiqqer_secure_coding` for PHP or template output.
- Load `quiqqer_extension_points` for XML registration, providers, package structure, or asset integration.

## Mental Model And Files

- A brick type is a PHP class extending `QUI\Control`. The bricks system reads its root-level `bricks.xml`
  entry and passes the saved brick settings to the control as attributes.
- `QUI\Control::create()` renders the outer element. `nodeName`, `class`, styles, JavaScript control data,
  and brick metadata belong to this outer element. `getBody()` returns only its inner HTML.
- An installed package's root-level `bricks.xml` is discovered automatically. No PHP provider is required
  for a normal brick registration.
- Keep the class autoloadable through the package's `composer.json` PSR-4 mapping. A typical brick uses:

  ```text
  package/
  +-- bricks.xml
  +-- locale.xml
  +-- composer.json
  +-- src/Vendor/Package/Bricks/
      +-- FeatureGrid.php
      +-- FeatureGrid.html
      +-- FeatureGrid.css
  ```

- Follow the package's existing `Bricks` or `Controls` namespace convention; both occur in QUIQQER.
- Declare every reused package in `composer.json`. Do not assume an optional package is installed.

## CSS Class Naming And BEM

- Derive the control root class from vendor, package, namespace folders below the package namespace, and control name:
  `vendor-package-folder-controlName`. For example, `QUI\Bricks\Controls\Image` in `quiqqer/bricks` uses
  `quiqqer-bricks-controls-image`.
- Set the root class through the PHP control's `class` attribute. Do not add a template wrapper only to carry the
  control class; `QUI\Control::create()` already renders the outer element.
- Use pragmatic BEM below that root: `root__element` for owned parts and `root--modifier` or `root__element--modifier`
  for real variants. Keep compound element and modifier names in lower camel case, matching patterns such as
  `quiqqer-bricks-layout__contentInner`.
- Do not force shared framework classes such as `control-header`, `control-content`, state classes, or utility classes
  into the control's BEM namespace.
- Treat newer controls such as MultiLayout and `QUI\Bricks\Layout\Layout` as naming references. Do not copy legacy
  short classes from older controls.

## Site And Project Context

The bricks runtime normally sets the current `Site` object on the control before rendering it. Still use a
typed helper with a rewrite fallback because controls can also be instantiated directly in tests, other
controls, or non-standard render flows:

```php
protected function getSite(): QUI\Interfaces\Projects\Site
{
    $Site = $this->getAttribute('Site');

    if ($Site instanceof QUI\Interfaces\Projects\Site) {
        return $Site;
    }

    $Site = QUI::getRewrite()->getSite();

    if (!$Site instanceof QUI\Interfaces\Projects\Site) {
        throw new QUI\Exception('No site available.');
    }

    $this->setAttribute('Site', $Site);

    return $Site;
}
```

- Check with `instanceof`, not only truthiness: control attributes are mixed values and the return type must
  be guaranteed.
- Throw when the brick requires a site and none exists. If rendering without a site is valid, return
  `?QUI\Interfaces\Projects\Site` instead and handle `null` explicitly.
- Use the inherited protected `$this->getProject()` from `QUI\Control` when only the current project is
  needed. Use `$this->getSite()->getProject()` when the project must belong to the resolved site.
- Do not assume a rewrite context in CLI, queue, test, or nested-control usage. Inject `Site` or `Project`
  explicitly in those contexts when available.

## Minimal Working Brick

Start with a PHP control, template, CSS file, XML registration, and locale variables. Add JavaScript or a
custom backend editor only when the requirement needs them.

### PHP Control

Set defaults before `parent::__construct($attributes)` so caller and saved setting values override them.
Keep PHP defaults even when XML defines editor defaults: controls are also instantiated directly and old
brick data may be incomplete.

```php
namespace Vendor\Package\Bricks;

use QUI;

class FeatureGrid extends QUI\Control
{
    private const GAP_PRESETS = [
        'small' => '0.75rem',
        'normal' => '1.5rem',
        'large' => '2.5rem'
    ];

    public function __construct(array $attributes = [])
    {
        $this->setAttributes([
            'nodeName' => 'section',
            'class' => 'vendor-package-bricks-featureGrid',
            'showTitle' => false,
            'gap' => 'normal'
        ]);

        parent::__construct($attributes);
        $this->addCSSFile(dirname(__FILE__) . '/FeatureGrid.css');
    }

    public function getBody(): string
    {
        $gap = (string)$this->getAttribute('gap');

        if (!isset(self::GAP_PRESETS[$gap])) {
            $gap = 'normal';
        }

        $this->setCustomVariable('gap', self::GAP_PRESETS[$gap]);

        $Engine = QUI::getTemplateManager()->getEngine();
        $Engine->assign('this', $this);

        return $Engine->fetch(dirname(__FILE__) . '/FeatureGrid.html');
    }

    private function setCustomVariable(string $name, string $value): void
    {
        if ($name === '' || $value === '') {
            return;
        }

        $this->setStyle('--_q-controlConf-' . $name, $value);
    }
}
```

### Template

The bricks runtime supplies standard brick attributes such as `frontendTitle` and `content`. Define
brick-specific display flags such as `showTitle` in the control and `bricks.xml`. Render the optional
generic content only when the brick should support it. Do not add another outer `section`;
`QUI\Control::create()` already creates it from `nodeName`.

```smarty
{if $this->getAttribute('showTitle') && $this->getAttribute('frontendTitle')}
    <header class="control-header">
        <h2>{$this->getAttribute('frontendTitle')|escape:'html'}</h2>
    </header>
{/if}

{if $this->getAttribute('content') != ''}
    <div class="control-content">
        {$this->getAttribute('content')}
    </div>
{/if}

<div class="control-template vendor-package-bricks-featureGrid__grid">
    {* Brick-specific output *}
</div>
```

Treat plain text as untrusted and escape it for its context. Output editor HTML or `nofilter` only when the
field explicitly carries HTML and the established input flow sanitizes it.

### Configurable CSS: Three Layers

For every setting-backed style, implement all three layers from `quiqqer_frontend_css_variables`:

1. Long public theming variable: `--vendor-package-featureGrid-gap`.
2. PHP-written config variable: `--_q-controlConf-gap`.
3. CSS fallback: the stable default.

Bind these once to a short private variable on the control root, then use only the short variable:

```css
.vendor-package-bricks-featureGrid {
    --_gap: var(--vendor-package-featureGrid-gap, var(--_q-controlConf-gap, 1.5rem));
}

.vendor-package-bricks-featureGrid__grid {
    display: grid;
    gap: var(--_gap);
}
```

Map editor presets to validated CSS values in PHP and call `setStyle()` only through
`--_q-controlConf-<name>`. Do not write the long theming variable from PHP. Let CSS own the theming hook and
fallback. The config variable is placed on the outer control and inherits into the template markup.

### Registration In bricks.xml

```xml
<quiqqer>
    <bricks>
        <brick control="\Vendor\Package\Bricks\FeatureGrid" hasContent="1">
            <title>
                <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.title"/>
            </title>
            <description>
                <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.description"/>
            </description>

            <settings>
                <setting name="showTitle" type="checkbox">
                    <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.showTitle"/>
                    <defaultValue>0</defaultValue>
                </setting>
                <setting name="gap" type="select">
                    <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.gap"/>
                    <option value="small">
                        <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.gap.small"/>
                    </option>
                    <option value="normal">
                        <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.gap.normal"/>
                    </option>
                    <option value="large">
                        <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.gap.large"/>
                    </option>
                    <defaultValue>normal</defaultValue>
                </setting>
            </settings>
        </brick>
    </bricks>
</quiqqer>
```

- Prefer `<defaultValue>` for new settings and keep it identical to the PHP default. Existing packages may
  contain legacy `default="1"` or `selected="selected"` forms; do not copy them without a compatibility
  reason.
- Omit `hasContent` or use `hasContent="1"` to expose the generic content editor. Use `hasContent="0"`
  only when editors must not receive that generic field; custom settings and custom tabs remain available.
- Use localized titles, descriptions, setting labels, and option labels from `locale.xml`. Ensure the
  locale group has the required `php` and/or `js` datatype when PHP or JavaScript reads it.
- Use standard setting types such as `text`, `number`, `checkbox`, `select`, `color`, and `hidden`. Reuse
  established controls and classes for site, media, or folder selection instead of rebuilding them.
- Add `recommended`, `deprecated`, `cacheable`, `inheritance`, `priority`, or `name` only for a concrete
  requirement.
- Add optional `preview` and `thumbnail` mockups using the existing package path and image-size convention.

## Choose The Editor Integration

Use the least complex editor surface that makes the setting understandable to editors.

### Standard Setting

Use an ordinary `<setting>` for a scalar value that is clear as a checkbox, input, or short select.

### Visual Setting Control

Use `data-qui` on a hidden setting when a visual choice is materially clearer than a select. The loaded
QUIControl owns the presentation, while the original input remains the stored value:

```xml
<setting name="layout" type="hidden"
         data-qui="package/vendor/package/bin/Controls/backend/LayoutSelect">
    <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.layout"/>
</setting>
```

In the backend control:

- Extend `QUIControl` in the normal AMD/`new Class` scaffold.
- Capture `this.getElm()` as the original input during `onImport` and hide or wrap it.
- Read the current value from the input and render the visual choices.
- Write every selection back to `input.value` and fire the control's `change` event.
- Use native buttons, keyboard handling, `aria-pressed`, and visible focus states.
- Normalize against an allowlist and keep the input value compatible with the PHP control.

Use `quiqqer/bricks/bin/Controls/backend/AccordionLayoutSelect.js` as the focused reference for a visual
layout picker. It produces the card selection shown inside the normal settings tab.

### Structured JSON Setting

Use a hidden setting with a custom backend control when editors manage a repeatable or nested structure:

```xml
<setting name="entries" type="hidden" label="false"
         data-qui="package/vendor/package/bin/Controls/backend/EntrySettings">
    <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.entries"/>
</setting>
```

- Treat the hidden input as the persistence boundary: parse its JSON on import and write the complete JSON
  document back after add, edit, delete, reorder, or enable/disable actions.
- Recover from empty, invalid, and legacy values; never assume decoded data has the current shape.
- Normalize the same schema again in PHP. Backend validation improves UX but is not a trust boundary.
- Keep the serialized field names stable or provide an explicit compatibility migration.

Use the Accordion entries editor as the compact list-editor reference. Use MultiLayout only when the data
is genuinely a complex responsive document; do not copy its complexity into ordinary repeaters.

### Custom Editor Tab

Use `<window><categories>` when a substantial editor needs its own navigation tab instead of crowding the
normal settings tab:

```xml
<window>
    <categories>
        <category name="feature-grid-entries" index="35">
            <text>
                <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.entries"/>
            </text>
            <image>fa fa-list</image>

            <settings name="feature-grid-entries">
                <title>
                    <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.entries"/>
                </title>
                <input conf="entries" type="hidden" label="false"
                       data-qui="package/vendor/package/bin/Controls/backend/EntrySettings">
                    <text>
                        <locale group="vendor/package" var="brick.featureGrid.entries"/>
                    </text>
                </input>
            </settings>
        </category>
    </categories>
</window>
```

- Keep `category name` unique and use `index` for its position in the brick window.
- Make `input conf` exactly match the PHP control attribute and persisted setting name.
- Use the Accordion `<window>` entry as the reference for a focused list tab.
- Use the MultiLayout `areas` category plus `MultiLayoutSettings`/`LayoutSettings` as the modern reference
  for a large visual editor with nested structured data.

## Frontend JavaScript

Attach frontend behavior either with a `qui-class` default or explicitly:

```php
$this->setJavaScriptControl('package/vendor/package/bin/Controls/FeatureGrid');
$this->setJavaScriptControlOption('mode', $normalizedMode);
```

Create an AMD module that extends `QUIControl`, initialize from `onImport`, and scope all DOM access to
`this.getElm()`. Select elements through `[data-name="..."]`, use vanilla event APIs, and keep ARIA state
synchronized. Do not use a CSS class as the JavaScript selector API.

## Compose Existing Controls

Prefer composing an installed control over reimplementing its behavior. The brick prepares normalized
data and settings, creates the child control, forwards its assets, and renders it with `create()`:

```php
$Carousel = new \QUI\Slider\Controls\Carousel([
    'slides' => $slides,
    'slidesPerView' => $slidesPerView
]);

$this->addCSSFiles($Carousel->getCSSFiles());
$Engine->assign('Carousel', $Carousel);
```

```smarty
{$Carousel->create()}
```

Declare `quiqqer/slider` in `composer.json` before using this example. Use
`quiqqer/slider/src/QUI/Slider/Bricks/Carousel.php` as the composition reference. Do not reference a brick
from a package that is not guaranteed to be installed.

## Reference Selection

Do not treat all controls in `quiqqer/bricks` as current examples; the package contains legacy PHP,
markup, CSS, and MooTools patterns. Use the core skills as the source of truth and inspect only the pattern
needed for the task:

- Visual scalar setting: `AccordionLayoutSelect.js` and the Accordion `template` setting.
- Focused custom tab and repeatable entries: Accordion `<window>` and `AccordionSettings.js`.
- Modern complex custom tab: MultiLayout `areas` category, `MultiLayoutSettings`, and `LayoutSettings`.
- Composed frontend control: `quiqqer/slider` Carousel brick.
- Configurable CSS: `quiqqer_frontend_css_variables` and its Breadcrumb reference.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the PSR-4 namespace, class path, `bricks.xml` control name, and declared package dependencies.
- Confirm the PHP control owns the convention-based root class and its owned markup uses pragmatic BEM names.
- Confirm XML defaults, PHP defaults, JavaScript defaults, and CSS fallbacks describe the same behavior.
- Confirm every locale exists and is available to PHP or JavaScript where required.
- Confirm scalar and structured settings are normalized in PHP, including invalid and legacy values.
- Confirm required Site or Project context works both through brick rendering and direct control usage.
- Confirm template output is escaped by context and deliberate HTML output has a documented trust boundary.
- Confirm configurable styling follows all three CSS-variable layers.
- Confirm interactive frontend and backend UI is semantic, keyboard accessible, and keeps ARIA state current.
- Confirm child-control CSS and other required assets reach the rendered page.
- Confirm existing brick instances retain their stored format and behavior unless a migration was requested.
- Run package-local checks when the task or repository instructions require validation. Test direct control
  construction, empty data, defaults, variants, invalid data, editor save/reload, and frontend rendering in
  an active template.
